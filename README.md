This repository is to support contributions for tools and new data entries for the D2A dataset hosted in DAX

The goal of this dataset is to create a unique, publicly available, open for contributions, code vulnerability dataset to foster new research in this field. Existing datasets, are not very transparent on their labeling methods, nor their data acquisition methods, some are synthetic and too simplistic, none offers data beyond the vulnerable function. We expect to improve and open the field of research in this space
