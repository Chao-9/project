# Dataset Usage Examples

The current dataset contains the samples generated from 6 open-source projects, namely. OpenSSL, FFmpeg, HTTPD, NGINX, Libtiff, and Libav. 

For each project, there are 3 `pickle.gz` files like `nginx_after_fix_extractor_0.pickle.gz`, `nginx_labeler_1.pickle.gz`, and `nginx_labeler_0.pickle.gz`, which are generated by two slightly different extractors (see `label_source` field in the sample format description).


## Viewing the Samples in Pickle Files

Each `pickle.gz` file contains compressed samples in JSON (e.g. [auto_labeler_1.json](samples/auto_labeler_1.json)). 

Function [print_sample()](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py#L24-L52) in [read_pickled_samples.py](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py) reads the JSON objects from pickle file and [decode the compressed static analysis output](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py#L49). 



## Data Preparation Example  

#### Split
We also provide a global split file `splits.tar.gz` (if download separately) or `splits.csv` (after decompression), which specifies the `train`, `dev`, and `test` sets:
```
id,split,project
httpd_82b42a45bba53a76fbf167dfe944131e785f5514_1,dev,httpd
...
httpd_1bd8218a89d7b01a14f6172cacfe0e61bee86689_1,test,httpd
...
httpd_598682ce281bf6f4783e9ad3b09639c1686add8e_1,train,httpd
...
```
For example, sample identified by `httpd_82b42a45bba53a76fbf167dfe944131e785f5514_1` belongs to the `dev` set.


#### Script

The example script [split_data.py](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py) takes the `splits.csv` ([line 9](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L9)) and the folder with the `pickle.gz` files ([line 13](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L13)) as input. It creates the inputs for BERT model training and testing in a folder specified at [line 14](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L14).
